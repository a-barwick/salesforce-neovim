# Salesforce, Meet Neovim

## The problem

You're involved with Salesforce development, and have a pestering itch to 
use Neovim with your day to day work. You search on Github and Reddit, but
all you find our premade Salesforce plugins instead of clear and simple guidance
on setting up your development environment.

## The solution

This repo will set you up with various flavors of "complete", from a minimal
config designed to help through the hard parts (LSPs and Treesitter), to
a full fledged IDE experience complete with Github copilot.

## How do I use this?

This default (main) branch has nothing but instructions, so switch to one
of the other branches like `minimal` or `ide` to get started. There is
no license, so feel free to steal as much as you want.
